1. When the client is run without the server run before in TCP, the result is given below:
    Oops! Sorry, couldn't connect to the server. Please try again :(
Reason: There is no server for it to connect

2. When the client is run without the server run before in UDP, it goes into an infinite loop i.e., the client keeps sending the message,
but it won't be received since there is no server.
